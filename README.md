# FizzBuzz TensorFlow

A small neural network that solves the popular *FizzBuzz* phone-screen problem using TensorFlow.

## Execution

Just run `python fizz-buzz.py` to train and execute the network. At the end you can input numbers at `stdin` to test the FizzBuzzer's ability to fizz, buzz or even fizz-buzz.
